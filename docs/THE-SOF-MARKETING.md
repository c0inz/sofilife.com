| **Price** | $52.99 | $175 |
| **Materials** | 100% coral fleece, microfiber outer | Faux fur trim + minky body |
| **Positioning** | Family fun, gift-giving, mass market | Premium, self-indulgence, TikTok aesthetic |
| **Sizing** | One size fits all | One size (oversized) |

## Why $175 Works

At 3x the price of competitors, The Sof needs to justify premium through:

### 1. Material Differentiation
- **Faux fur trim** — Visible luxury, tactile difference
- **Minky fabric** — Softer than coral fleece, more premium hand-feel
- Photos/videos must SHOW the texture difference

### 2. Unboxing Experience
- Premium packaging (tissue, ribbon, branded box)
- "This feels expensive" moment on camera
- Include care card, thank you note from Sofi

### 3. Scarcity/Drops
- Limited quantities per colorway
- "Drop" model vs. always-in-stock catalog
- Creates urgency, FOMO, collectibility

### 4. Brand Story
- Sofi as designer/founder (face of brand)
- Behind-the-scenes content (fabric sourcing, design process)
- Authentic, not corporate

## TikTok Strategy

### Content Pillars

**1. Texture ASMR**
- Close-up shots of the faux fur, minky fabric
- "Hear that? That's $175 worth of soft"

- Reaction videos (gifts, self-purchase)
- "My face when I finally got The Sof"

**3. Lifestyle/Mood**

- Aspirational but attainable
- "This is my personality now"

**4. Comparison Content**
- "I tried the $50 blanket hoodie vs. The Sof"
- Side-by-side texture, quality
- Not trashing competitors, just showing difference

**5. Behind the Scenes**
- Sofi picking fabrics
- Sample arrivals
- Packaging process

### TikTok Shop Integration
